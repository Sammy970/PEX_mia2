# Pixel Extended Setup for MI A2
Hello everyone!! 

DISCLAIMER : THIS IS FOR MI A2 ONLY. 

Welcome to my Github.
I am Samyak Jain, and in this repo I have made 2 files for mi a2 which will help anyone to sync the PEX source, curl repo, update or upgrade your linux, Clone Device tree, kernel, vendor for mi a2.
All of this is AUTOMATED.

So I have created two files for mi a2.
1. fastgcp.sh
2. script_gcp.sh
*******************************************************************

A. fastgcp.sh

In this file you just dont need to do anything, it will automatically setup your build environment with specific things that are needed

B. scripts_gcp.sh

This file will do the same as above, but this is like a question and answer.
For eg, Do you want to curl repo ? if you press 1 for Yes then it would curl repo, but if you press 2 then it would just move on to the next question.
With this file you have the control on what do you want.
